## Notes
- The module works for PowerShell 5 and PowerShell 7.
- The module is based on Microsoft.ApplicationInsights (2.18.0). This version is tagged as deprecated but 
    with PowerShell 7, there is still a dependency conflict with the current versio (2.20) at the moment. Therefore, the outdated package is currently still used.

## Sample Result
The invoking script and parameters are automatically captured, so you don't have to do it yourself.

## Application Map (Experimental ðŸš§)
**Please dont use this in production** 

With the command "Send-AppInsightsOperation", a dependency and a request can be combined to display an application map. In this way, the dependencies can be displayed in a module.
